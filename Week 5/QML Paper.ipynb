Predicting the most stable arrangement of atoms in a molecule is one of the most important tasks in quantum chemistry. Essentially, this is an optimization problem where the total energy of the molecule is minimized with respect to the positions of the atomic nuclei. The molecular geometry obtained from this calculation is in fact the starting point for many simulations of molecular properties. If the geometry is inaccurate, then any calculations that rely on it may also be inaccurate.
