# Implementation of QML Paper[^1]
The last phase of the project was to implement a QML paper of our choice. The QML paper, implemented in here is [Variational quantum algorithm for molecular geometry optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13840). :electron:

[^1]: A quick warning: The program takes 30-40 minutes to run, if you are going to download the file and run, make sure that you have some way to pass your time.
