# Introduction to QC and Linear Algebra
## What is a Quantum Bit?
_Quantum Bit_ is analogous to the classical bit, which is the fundamental unit of information used in most computers today - but the important distinction between them comes in how the information is _stored_ not _measured_. While a classical bit can only store a _0_ or a _1_ the quantum bit is stored as a linear combination of _computational basis states_
